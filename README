  This is a sample solution for "Name app V2" EC assignment for the event handling lab.

"Name app V2:  Now change the first name input tag to include a value change listener.  
The listener should be activated when the user tabs out of the Name field, i.e., onblur.  
If your value change listener finds the first name in the database of names, then it should 
set the last name of the bean field using the name from the database.  Does this work?  
Try making the last name field be an output rather than an input.  Does it work now?  
Why might there be a difference?  Try having both the output and input fields for the last name."
(See comments in the PersonBean for answers to the questions.)

Hint:  try using this in fillLast instead of setLast(enteredFirst);

        UIComponent firstUIInput = e.getComponent();
        UIInput lastUIInput = (UIInput) firstUIInput.findComponent("lastName");
        lastUIInput.setValue(enteredFirst);
